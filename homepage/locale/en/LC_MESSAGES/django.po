msgstr "The 3Dify app is a nice example of a solution where I used technologies from many different fields to realize a complex idea. It uses computer vision to reconstruct the depth of an image. However, this only works if the smartphone has 2 or more cameras. On other smartphones, an AI model is used to interpret depth information into the image. The generated depth data can then be used to turn the photo into a 3D photo. By applying bilateral filtering and parallax mapping, the user can re-experience the photo in 3D. These are techniques that are also used in recent computer graphics engines such as Unreal Engine 5."
