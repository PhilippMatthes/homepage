# Homepage

My new homepage, based on Django and Webpack.

## Quickstart

- Run `python3 -m pip install --user -r requirements.txt` or use your favorite venv to setup all Python dependencies.
- Run `python3 homepage/manage.py runserver` to access the development server at [`localhost:8000`](http://127.0.0.1:8000)
- If you need to modify any SCSS or TypeScript, run `yarn install` to install all Webpack dependencies and `yarn dev` or `yarn prod` to build the assets into the `/static/dist/` folder. 

## License

`TODO:` I am not sure yet, which license I will apply to this project. Stay tuned.
